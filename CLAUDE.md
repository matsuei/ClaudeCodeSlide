# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

This is currently an empty project directory. As the project develops, this file should be updated with:

## Current Configuration

The project has Claude Code settings configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` that allow:
- `ls` commands for directory listing
- `find` commands for file searching

## Next Steps

When the project is populated with code, update this file to include:
1. Specific build, test, and development commands
2. High-level architecture documentation
3. Important project-specific conventions
